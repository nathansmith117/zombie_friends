# Zombie Friends
Zombie Friends is based in part on the work of the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).

# What is Zombie Friends?
It is a crazy top down rpg zombie game where you play the
zombie.

# Compiling Unix/Linux
Needs fltk to compile.  Tested with fltk 1.3.8.  Other versions many not work correctly.

Make sure to compile fltk with ./configure CFLAGS="-fPIC" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"

Just typing "make" in the command line will work most of the
time.  Tested with gcc/g++ compiler others many not work.

# Compiling windows
Same as unix but needs mingw and cygwin to compile.
