# Zombie Friends
Zombie Friends is based in part on the work of the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).

# What is Zombie Friends?
It is a crazy top down rpg zombie game where you play the
zombie.

# Licensing
It is free, open source and you can mod it.  

You can not sell the mods or the game and you must ask the creator to sell t-shirts, posters and
ther merch.

This game has some questionable content and you have no right
to sue me for something you did not like.

No suing if something does not work correctly or if the game
breaks something.

# Compiling Unix/Linux
Needs fltk to compile.  Tested with fltk 1.3.8.  Other versions many not work correctly.

Just typing "make" in the command line will work most of the
time.  Tested with gcc/g++ compiler others many not work.

# Compiling windows
Same as unix but needs mingw and cygwin to compile.
